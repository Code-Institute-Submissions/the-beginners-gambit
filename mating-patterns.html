          <p>
            In chess there are several patterns that occur in checkmates, and
            they occur frequently enough that they all have their own names.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning these patterns are important as they will help you
            recognise the possibilites of checkmate when they arise in your
            games.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many checkmate patterns out there but here are some of the
            ones that a beginner should know.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="queen-combinations">
              Queen Combinations
            </h2>
            <p>
              The queen is the most deadly of pieces for performing a checkmate
              - at close range, the queen can trap the enemy king at the side of
              the board and cover all the king’s escape squares by itself.
              Despite this power, the queen can still be captured like any other
              piece, so usually the queen relies on the support of a second
              piece when delivering checkmate.
            </p>
            <p>
              For beginners the most common queen mates will occur on the h7 and
              g7 squares, however you can apply these queen combinations from
              anywhere on the board if you have the pieces available.
            </p>

              <figure>
                <p class="h5 fig-subheading">H7 Pawn Structure</p>
                <img

                  alt="Illustration of a common black pawn structure "
                />
                <p class="align-center">
                  This is a normal, healthy kingside pawn structure for Black,
                  and though it’s usually quite safe, experienced players
                  understand that h7 is vulnerable since it is only defended by
                  its King. This means that if white’s Queen can attack h7 with
                  the protection of one of its other pieces, white can look for
                  checkmate.

                />
                <p class="align-center">
                  This structure is usually seen when Black finachettos his dark
                  squared Bishop, as illustrated in the next above. If you are
                  able to remove the dark squared bishop from play or the bishop
                  is not on that diagonal, then that means the f6, g7, h6
                  squares are all potentially vulnerable.

              Rooks are less powerful than the queen, and therefore usually need

                This is a pattern that commonly appears in the end game. The
                example above is most commonly referred to as the the ladder
                mate as you force the king to move file-by-file until it is
                checkmate. But there are multiple ways you can mate your
                opponent utilising the cutting off of files with your rooks.

                    check. You can also execute this mate with a queen rather
                    than a rook.

                Back Rank Mate
              </h3>
              <p>
                The back rank checkmate is another common pattern that occurs
                when a king is trapped behind its own pawns and gets mated by
                either a rook or queen.

              <p>
                In most situations the pawn shield does a great job to protect
                the king, but you should be aware of the potential back rank
                weakness.
              </p>
              <p>
                One way to deal with this weakness is to play a move known as
                creating “luft” (German word for “air”), a chess term which
                means you open an escape square for your king, usually by
                advancing the g or h pawn one square.

            <p>
              The smothered mate is a checkmate pattern that is only possible if
              the enemy king is completely surrounded by his own pieces. It also
              features the unique jumping ability of the knight. Though a unique
              checkmate, it is a suprisingly common checkmate.

                  to checkmate.

              The suffocation mate is a variation of the smothered mate but
              involves the use of a bishop (or queen) and knight to execute.

                  This was a game the first official world chess champion,
                  Wilhelm Steinitz, played blindfolded. Here you can see that a
                  smothered check is possible through knight to e7 but it is
                  defended by black’s queen. However Steinitz brilliantly played
                  rook to g3, delivering check and forcing black to capture the
                  rook with queen to g3, removing the defender of the e7 square.
                  With this white can finally play knight to e7 and deliver a
                  suffocation mate.
