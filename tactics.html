                <p>
                    Now that you’ve gone through some opening principles for the opening, the midgame is all about
                    coming up with tactics and combinations to attack the opponent king.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are varying definitions for what constitutes a tactic or a combination but the simplest way to
                    think of these two concepts as a beginner is that a tactic in chess is a move or series of moves
                    that give you an advantage on the board, whether its material gain or an attack that leads to
                    checkmate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A combination is thought of as a forced sequence of moves that involves a sacrifice of a piece that
                    either leads to checkmate or a clear advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s take a look at some of the most common tactical motifs that you should be familiar with.
                </p>

                    <h2 class="h4">Forks</h2>
                    <p>
                        A fork (also known as a double attack) is a tactic where a piece threatens to capture more than
                        1 piece at the same time. It’s most commonly executed with a knight but you can fork with a
                        rook, bishop, queen, even a pawn.
                    </p>
                    <div class="fig-container">

                                This is an illustrative example of a knight threatening two pieces at once.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        A fork is a powerful tactic because it is usually hard for your opponent to defend against 2
                        threats at once if the knight that is forking cannot be captured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If one of the pieces being forked is a king and the attacking knight cannot be captured, then
                        the other piece is a guaranteed capture as the king has to move out of check.
                    </p>

                                This example is common in lower levels of play. Here black doesn’t pay attention to the
                                threat of a fork on the f7 square and allows the knight to capture the pawn forking both
                                the
                                queena and the rook. The king cannot capture as the knight is defended by the bishop and
                                so
                                blacks only response is to move the queen to safety while the rook is lost.

                                Here the white has a pawn fork on both of black’s knights. Black cannot defend both and
                                so
                                it has to get 1 to safety while the other is lost.

                    <h2 class="h4">Pins</h2>
                    <p>
                        A pin is a tactic in which a piece is inhibited from moving because doing so would expose the
                        more valuable piece behind it to the threat of capture. If the piece behind was the king then it
                        would be known as an <strong>absolute pin</strong> as the piece being pinned would be unable to
                        move as it would put the king in check. A regular pin would be referred to as a <strong>relative
                            pin</strong> and is when the piece shielded by the pinned piece is a piece other than the
                        king, but usually more valuable than the pinned piece.
                    </p>

                                alt="Illustration of a relative pin and an absolute pin">

                                An absolute pin vs a relative pin. The queen on the left is unable move as doing so
                                would
                                put the king in check. The bishop on the right can move, but if it did, it would expose
                                the
                                more valuable queen behind it to the threat of capture.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The power of a pin lies in the fact that the pinned piece is unable to move at the risk of
                        exposing a more valuable piece (or in the case of an absolute pin, unable to move at all). Thus
                        from there you can start to take advantage of the pin and potentially win the pinned piece or
                        the piece behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pins can only be executed by the the 3 long range pieces. Namely the rooks, queen and bishops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The previous example showed the rook orchestrating a pin, here are some more examples:

                        </figure>

                            <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                                This example showcases how powerful a queen can be. Here the queen has 2 relative pins
                                on black’s knight and bishop.
                                If black tries to capture the knight then the rook behind is exposed. If black tries to
                                capture the bishop, then the queen is exposed. This example shows why high-valued pieces
                                are not ideal defenders.
