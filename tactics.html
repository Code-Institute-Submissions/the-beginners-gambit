          <p>
            Now that you’ve gone through some opening principles for the
            opening, the midgame is all about coming up with tactics and
            combinations to attack the opponent king.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are varying definitions for what constitutes a tactic or a
            combination but the simplest way to think of these two concepts as a
            beginner is that a tactic in chess is a move or series of moves that
            give you an advantage on the board, whether its material gain or an
            attack that leads to checkmate.
          </p>
          <p>
            A combination is thought of as a forced sequence of moves that
            involves a sacrifice of a piece that either leads to checkmate or a
            clear advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s take a look at some of the most common tactical motifs that
            you should be familiar with.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="forks">Forks</h2>
            <p>
              A fork (also known as a double attack) is a tactic where a piece
              threatens to capture more than 1 piece at the same time. It’s most
              commonly executed with a knight but you can fork with a rook,
              bishop, queen, even a pawn.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-container">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="assets/img/tactics/fork.svg"
                  alt="Illustration of a knight forking 2 rooks"
                />
                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  This is an illustrative example of a knight threatening two
                  pieces at once.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              A fork is a powerful tactic because it is usually hard for your
              opponent to defend against 2 threats at once if the knight that is
              forking cannot be captured.
            </p>
            <p>
              If one of the pieces being forked is a king and the attacking
              knight cannot be captured, then the other piece is a guaranteed
              capture as the king has to move out of check.

                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  This example is common in lower levels of play. Here black
                  doesn’t pay attention to the threat of a fork on the f7 square
                  and allows the knight to capture the pawn forking both the
                  queena and the rook. The king cannot capture as the knight is
                  defended by the bishop and so blacks only response is to move
                  the queen to safety while the rook is lost.

            <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="pins">Pins</h2>
            <p>
              A pin is a tactic in which a piece is inhibited from moving
              because doing so would expose the more valuable piece behind it to
              the threat of capture. If the piece behind was the king then it
              would be known as an <strong>absolute pin</strong> as the piece
              being pinned would be unable to move as it would put the king in
              check. A regular pin would be referred to as a
              <strong>relative pin</strong> and is when the piece shielded by
              the pinned piece is a piece other than the king, but usually more
              valuable than the pinned piece.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-container expandable">
              <figure class="full-width">
                <img

                  alt="Illustration of a relative pin and an absolute pin"
                />
                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  An absolute pin vs a relative pin. The queen on the left is
                  unable move as doing so would put the king in check. The
                  bishop on the right can move, but if it did, it would expose
                  the more valuable queen behind it to the threat of capture.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              The power of a pin lies in the fact that the pinned piece is
              unable to move at the risk of exposing a more valuable piece (or
              in the case of an absolute pin, unable to move at all). Thus from
              there you can start to take advantage of the pin and potentially
              win the pinned piece or the piece behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pins can only be executed by the the 3 long range pieces. Namely
              the rooks, queen and bishops.
            </p>
            <p>
              The previous example showed the rook orchestrating a pin, here are
              some more examples:

                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  Here the white bishop has an absolute pin. Black’s king and
                  queen are on the same diagonal and so black has no choice to
                  trade its queen for a less valuable piece.

                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  This example showcases how powerful a queen can be. Here the
                  queen has 2 relative pins on black’s knight and bishop. If
                  black tries to capture the knight then the rook behind is
                  exposed. If black tries to capture the bishop, then the queen
                  is exposed. This example shows why high-valued pieces are not
                  ideal defenders.

            <p>
              Think of skewers as the opposite of pins. Whereas the piece behind
              the pinned piece is more valuable, in a skewer the more valuable
              piece is in front. Skewers are effective in winning pieces that
              are only defended by higher value material.
            </p>

                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  Here white’s bishop has a skewer on black’s queen. The queen
                  must get to safety otherwise black is just losing a queen, but
                  doing so exposes the rook on d8 for capture. Black can capture
                  but the bishop is defended by white’s queen. This skewer
                  results in rook for bishop trade which is advantageous for
                  white.

            </div>
            <p>
              Like pins you also have relative skewers and absolute skewers.
              Absolute skewers involve the king, therefore they cannot be
              ignored. An absolute skewer guarantees the loss of material,
              because the defender is forced to either get their king out of
              check or block the check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that with skewers, the more valuable piece is in front,
              so a relative skewer would mean that the high value piece is under
              attack, and moving the piece would expose a lower value piece.

              Discovered Attacks
            </h2>
            <p>
              This tactic is employed when you move a piece to reveal a
              previously blocked threat by another piece. The power of a
              discovered attack lies in the fact that you can potentially use
              the moving piece to make a strong threat on its own.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the piece that moves delivers a check, this is known as a
              discovered check. Here’s an example:

                  the rook to c3, giving a check on white’s king, black’s queen
                  is now threatening capture whereas before, this threat was
                  blocked by the rook. White has to respond to the check by
                  either blocking it or moving the king but either way the queen
                  is lost.

              Discoveries are a powerful tactic as you have multiple ways to
              employ them on the board to gain an advantage.

            <p>
              Here is a position in which white executes a discovery using the
              moving piece to create a double attack that black can’t defend
              against.

            <p>
              Removing the defender in chess refers to capturing a piece that is
              performing a defensive role.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a important tactic in chess as it often leads to a
              material gain or a positional advantage on the board.

                  Black can take advantage of the fact that white’s bishop on d4
                  is only defended by 1 piece. By removing it’s defender with
                  the bishop, white has to retake with the queen and has no way
                  to defend against it’s bishop being captured and black forking
                  both white’s king and rook, further losing material.

              Being able to recognise when you can employ this tactic comes with
              time and experience, but a good tip in trying to identify when you
              can is when you are trying to make an attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there is a piece defending against the attack, look at the
              position and see if that defending piece is in turn being defended
              itself, and if so, are you in a position to remove it without new
              defenders strengthening the original defender.

                  White’s rook to g4 is an absolute pin on black’s queen, but
                  the square is defended twice by the pawn on f5 and the bishop
                  on c7. White can remove both defenders here but it has to do
                  so in the correct order. Once the defenders are removed, rook
                  to g1 wins black’s queen.
