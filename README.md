[View Deployed Site Here](https://arlandfran.github.io/the-beginners-gambit/)

A minimal, documentation-style site for the rules of Chess. The site features fully responsive design, eight pages of content and pure CSS implementations of traditional Javascript enabled features such as off-canvas sidebars and accordions.

The goals for this site are:

- Introduce chess to new players.
- Provide digestible content with images and diagrams.
- Be easily shareable.

The goals for the user are:

- Learn how to play chess.
- Be able to reference the rules on a variety of devices.
