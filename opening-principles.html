                <p>
                    Here are some guiding chess principles that a beginner should follow for the opening phase of the
                    game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that these aren’t strict rules and there will be situations that will be exceptions to
                    these principles. But as they say, you must first master the rules before you can break them!
                </p>
                <section>
                    <h2 class="h4">Develop Your Pieces</h2>
                    <p>
                        Development of your pieces is the most <strong>important rule</strong> beginners should follow
                        in the opening.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aim of developing is to get your pieces out as fast possible. A common mistake beginners
                        make is only utilising a few pieces of on their board, never bringing their other pieces into
                        play unless it’s to reinforce or recapture another piece.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A player that is able to get a lead in development has an advantage as it’s their pieces that
                        are in position to attack first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There isn’t a strict order when it comes to development, but it’s generally best to develop your
                        knights and bishops before your queen and rooks. It’s also sound to develop the knight and
                        bishop on the side you want to castle so you can get your king castled quickly.
                    </p>

                            <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                                In this example notice that the center pawns and all of the minor pieces have been
                                developed toward the center and the king is ready to castle kingside. This is a common
                                beginner-friendly opening called the ‘London system’.
                            </figcaption>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        A good way to ensure that you’re developing your pieces is to make sure that all of your knights
                        and bishops have been developed by move 10.

                    <h2 class="h4">Control the Center</h2>
                    <p>
                        Just like how having the high ground is advantageous in real battle, being able to control the
                        center is advantageous on the chess board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why?</strong> Well pieces placed in the center have more mobility, threaten more squares
                        on the board and
                        attacks focused on the center tend to be effective.
                    </p>
                    <div class="fig-container">
                        <figure class="full-width">
                            <img src="assets/img/opening-principles/knight-center-control.svg"
                                alt="Illustration comparison of center knight control vs knight on the edge of the board">
                            <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                                This classic example demonstrates how effective a knight in the center can be compared
                                to a knight on the edge of the board. The white knight controls double the squares of
                                the black knight, and is also controlling 2 of the squares the black knight can jump to
                                further limiting its mobility.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>center</strong> most commonly referres to the squares d4, d5, e4, e5.
                    </p>
                    <div class="fig-container">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets/img/opening-principles/center-squares.svg"
                                alt="Illustration of the center squares of the chess board">
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Just as how knights are much more effective in the center, bishops and pawns are also very
                        effective in the center.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Putting pawns in the center cramps the opponent and removes their options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you control the center squares, you can begin thinking about working pieces into strong
                        points on the opponent's side of the board. Pawns on the the 5th rank can protect pieces on the
                        6th and so on. Being able to have pieces in the center can allow for some dangerous attacks if
                        the opponent isn’t careful.
                    </p>

                                This is a rather extreme example but a common mistake beginners make is not developing
                                towards the center. You can see here that white is completely developed with strong
                                center control and the king ready to castle. On the otherside black’s center control is
                                non-existent and its knights are poorly placed with little mobility.

                    <h2 class="h4">Avoid moving the same piece twice</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ideally you should complete your development before movnig a piece twice. In the opening, it’s
                        really important that you don’t waste time when instead you could be developing pieces that are
                        still in their starting squares. The only time you should move the same piece twice is if it’s
                        to capture another piece. Remember you need to have all of your pieces in play to win.
                    </p>

                                An exaggerated example but not unheard of in games between beginner players. Here black
                                is chased around whites pieces, losing time and at the same time helping develop whites
                                pieces. By the end, the knight is left with no squares to move and is trapped
                                completely.

                    <h2 class="h4">Dont bring out your pieces too early</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now the queen is the exception when it comes to early development. When you bring out the queen
                        too early, the enemy can attack the queen with pieces less valuable than it and force you to
                        waste tempo or worse, get your queen trapped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ideally you should bring out the queen after castling your king to safety. Once your minor
                        pieces have been developed, your queen can better co-ordinate with your pieces to orchestrate
                        attacks.
                    </p>

                                The queen can capture the bishop on b5 but after that the white knight can deliver check
                                on c7 forking both the king and queen. Either way black’s queen is lost.
