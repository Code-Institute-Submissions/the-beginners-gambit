          <p>
            Now that you’ve learnt the rules, it’s time to take a look at some
            core concepts that you should understand as a beginner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding these concepts will not only improve your gameplay but
            also increase your enjoyment of the game as you naturally improve,
            learn to spot tactics and win games. So let’s take a look!
          </p>

          <h2 class="h4">Phases of the Game</h2>
          <p>
            The game can be divided into three phases. Each phase has its own
            strategic concerns and a lot of theory has been explored over the
            years on each of these phases.
          </p>
          <div class="accordion">
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <input type="checkbox" class="accordion-toggle" id="opening" />
              <label for="opening" class="accordion-title">
                The Opening
              </label>
              <div class="accordion-content px-1">
                <p>
                  The opening refers to the first moves of the game. There are 3
                  main strategic aims in the opening:
                </p>
                <ol class="indent">
                  <li>Develop your pieces</li>
                  <li>Control the center</li>
                  <li>Bring your king to safety</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Development of your pieces simply means moving them from their
                  starting squares onto more advantageous squares, and control
                  of the center is another important opening principle that can
                  be achieved by developing your pieces toward the center.
                  Castling is the most common way of getting your king to safety
                  and castling early is recommended as an exposed king can lead
                  to troublesome attacks if you’re not careful.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <input type="checkbox" class="accordion-toggle" id="middlegame" />
              <label for="middlegame" class="accordion-title">
                The Middlegame
              </label>
              <div class="accordion-content px-1">
                <p>
                  There isn’t a defined point at which the game transitions from
                  the opening to the middlegame, but generally it’s when most or
                  all of the pieces have moved from their starting squares and
                  the king has been moved to safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The middlegame is the most exciting part of chess as it’s the
                  phase of the game that feels most like a strategic battle.
                  There are no set rules on the best way to approach the middle
                  game, as there are so many different positions that can occur
                  on the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s all about tactics, tactics, tactics. And the player that
                  can come up with and co-ordinate the best combination of moves
                  will win the game.
                </p>
                <div class="page-nav-link">
                  <a href="#" class="page-link">Tactics ➡</a>

                The Endgame

                <p>
                  Similar to the middlegame there isn’t an exact definition of
                  when the game transitions into the endgame, but at this
                  stage most of the pieces will have been captured, the kings
                  are active and it becomes more difficult to deliver
                  checkmate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This usually shifts the the strategic focus from attacking
                  the king to escorting your pawns to the end of the board to
                  promote to a queen.

            Each piece in the game has an assigned value relative to that of a pawn which is worth 1 point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knights & bishops are both worth 3 points and are known as <strong>minor pieces</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rooks are worth 5 points and the queen 9 points, they are known as <strong>major pieces</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The king does not have a value because it cannot be captured, though it is able to capture other pieces if
            able.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the piece values are not formally part of the rules, being able to calculate material will help you
            recognise when an exchange is winning, when you have a material advantage on the board and to execute
            multiple
            attacks on the enemy king with your material lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do keep in mind however that the objective of the game is to checkmate the king, not win the most material!
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="h4">Tempo</h2>
          <p>
            In chess, a tempo is regarded as a “turn” or “move”. The concept of tempo is important in chess as when one
            player gains a tempo, it effectively means that his opponent has been forced to waste one or more moves.
            This is usually done by developing a piece that attacks another piece of <strong>greater value</strong>,
            this results in the more valuable piece having to move or be captured.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefit of gaining a tempo is that it enables a player to develop their pieces more swiftly and
            effectively. In the opening part of a game, this usually results in a lead in development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a example showcasing how white can lose tempo with what looks like a simple developing move. The
            reason this is a mistake is black can simply play pawn to d5 and now white has to waste a tempo bringing
            the bishop to safety.
          </p>
          <figure class="section-column">
            <img src="assets/img/concepts/lose-tempo.svg" alt="Illustration of white losing tempo">
          </figure>
          <p>
            Tempo is gained when you make a move that forces your opponent to respond. The more you can force your
            opponent to respond to your moves is less time for them setting up their own strategies and attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example black wants to play knight captures bishop e3. Why? Because after the queen captures
            back, then black can play bishop d4 - an absolute pin on white’s queen. However white is currently
            threatening to take black’s queen on a5. Here black can play queen to h5. This move not only brings the
            the queen to safety but also makes a threatens checkmate at the same time. Thus white is forced to
            defend against it, getting black the tempo it needs to play knight takes bishop e3.
          </p>
          <figure class="section-column">
            <img src="assets/img/concepts/gain-tempo.svg" alt="Illustration of black gaining tempo">
          </figure>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="h4">Pawn Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Pawn structures are more of an intermediate concept but it’s something to keep in mind as you start to gain
            experience with chess. A pawn structure is the configuration of pawns on the chess board and since pawns are
            the least mobile of all the pieces, the structure is mainly static during the opening and middle phases of
            the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pawns are the only pieces in the game that cannot move backwards, so it’s very important to not leave any
            weaknesses in your pawn structure for the enemy to exploit. A strong pawn structure is advantageous as the
            pawns can defend themselves, and your pieces don’t have to be anchored defending pawns when they can
            available for more useful purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your objective here is to keep your pawn structure strong while weakening your opponent’s. Pawn structures
            affect the development of pieces and determines which squares are weak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some cases where the pawns are weak and cannot defend themselves:
          </p>
          <section>
            <h3 class="h5">Isolated Pawns</h3>
            <p>
              Isolated pawns are pawns that don’t have any pawns on either side of them. Here they don’t have support
              from other pawns and if they are attacked they will require support from their pieces.
            </p>
            <div class="section justify-center">
              <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/concepts/isolated-pawns.svg" alt="Illustration of isolated pawns">
                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  In this example white has 2 isolated pawns and black has 1.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p>
              One thing to keep in mind is that although isolated pawns are generally weak, the open files next to them
              increases the mobility of your pieces, particularly for the rooks that enjoy open files.
