          <p>
            Now that you’ve learnt the rules, it’s time to take a look at some
            core concepts that you should understand as a beginner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding these concepts will not only improve your gameplay but
            also increase your enjoyment of the game as you naturally improve,
            learn to spot tactics and win games. So let’s take a look!
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="phases-of-the-game">Phases of the Game</h2>
          <p>
            The game can be divided into three phases. Each phase has its own
            strategic concerns and a lot of theory has been explored over the
            years on each of these phases.
          </p>
          <div class="accordion">
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <input type="checkbox" class="accordion-toggle" id="opening" />
              <label for="opening" class="accordion-title">
                The Opening
              </label>
              <div class="accordion-content px-1">
                <p>
                  The opening refers to the first moves of the game. There are 3
                  main strategic aims in the opening:
                </p>
                <ol class="indent">
                  <li>Develop your pieces</li>
                  <li>Control the center</li>
                  <li>Bring your king to safety</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Development of your pieces simply means moving them from their
                  starting squares onto more advantageous squares, and control
                  of the center is another important opening principle that can
                  be achieved by developing your pieces toward the center.
                  Castling is the most common way of getting your king to safety
                  and castling early is recommended as an exposed king can lead
                  to troublesome attacks if you’re not careful.

                The Middlegame
              </label>
              <div class="accordion-content px-1">
                <p>
                  There isn’t a defined point at which the game transitions from
                  the opening to the middlegame, but generally it’s when most or
                  all of the pieces have moved from their starting squares and
                  the king has been moved to safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The middlegame is the most exciting part of chess as it’s the
                  phase of the game that feels most like a strategic battle.
                  There are no set rules on the best way to approach the middle
                  game, as there are so many different positions that can occur
                  on the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s all about tactics, tactics, tactics. And the player that
                  can come up with and co-ordinate the best combination of moves
                  will win the game.
                </p>
                <div class="page-nav-link">
                  <a href="#" class="page-link">Tactics</a>

                The Endgame

                <p>
                  Similar to the middlegame there isn’t an exact definition of
                  when the game transitions into the endgame, but at this
                  stage most of the pieces will have been captured, the kings
                  are active and it becomes more difficult to deliver
                  checkmate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This usually shifts the the strategic focus from attacking
                  the king to escorting your pawns to the end of the board to
                  promote to a queen.

            Each piece in the game has an assigned value relative to that of a pawn which is worth 1 point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knights & bishops are both worth 3 points and are known as <strong>minor pieces</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rooks are worth 5 points and the queen 9 points, they are known as <strong>major pieces</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The king does not have a value because it cannot be captured, though it is able to capture other pieces if
            able.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the piece values are not formally part of the rules, being able to calculate material will help you
            recognise when an exchange is winning, when you have a material advantage on the board and to execute
            multiple
            attacks on the enemy king with your material lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do keep in mind however that the objective of the game is to checkmate the king, not win the most material!

        <section>
          <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="tempo">Tempo</h2>
          <p>
            In chess, a tempo is regarded as a “turn” or “move”. The concept of tempo is important in chess as when one
            player gains a tempo, it effectively means that his opponent has been forced to waste one or more moves.
            This is usually done by developing a piece that attacks another piece of <strong>greater value</strong>,
            this results in the more valuable piece having to move or be captured.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefit of gaining a tempo is that it enables a player to develop their pieces more swiftly and
            effectively. In the opening part of a game, this usually results in a lead in development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a example showcasing how white can lose tempo with what looks like a simple developing move. The
            reason this is a mistake is black can simply play pawn to d5 and now white has to waste a tempo bringing
            the bishop to safety.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-container">
            <figure>
              <img src="assets/img/concepts/lose-tempo.svg" alt="Illustration of white losing tempo">
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            Tempo is gained when you make a move that forces your opponent to respond. The more you can force your
            opponent to respond to your moves is less time for them setting up their own strategies and attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example black wants to play knight captures bishop e3. Why? Because after the queen captures
            back, then black can play bishop d4 - an absolute pin on white’s queen. However white is currently
            threatening to take black’s queen on a5. Here black can play queen to h5. This move not only brings the
            the queen to safety but also makes a threatens checkmate at the same time. Thus white is forced to
            defend against it, getting black the tempo it needs to play knight takes bishop e3.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-container">
            <figure>
              <img src="assets/img/concepts/gain-tempo.svg" alt="Illustration of black gaining tempo">

        <section>
          <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="pawn-structure">Pawn Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Pawn structures are more of an intermediate concept but it’s something to keep in mind as you start to gain
            experience with chess. A pawn structure is the configuration of pawns on the chess board and since pawns are
            the least mobile of all the pieces, the structure is mainly static during the opening and middle phases of
            the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pawns are the only pieces in the game that cannot move backwards, so it’s very important to not leave any
            weaknesses in your pawn structure for the enemy to exploit. A strong pawn structure is advantageous as the
            pawns can defend themselves, and your pieces don’t have to be anchored defending pawns when they can
            available for more useful purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your objective here is to keep your pawn structure strong while weakening your opponent’s. Pawn structures
            affect the development of pieces and determines which squares are weak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some cases where the pawns are weak and cannot defend themselves:
          </p>
          <section>
            <h3 class="h5 subheader-link" id="isolated-pawns">Isolated Pawns</h3>
            <p>
              Isolated pawns are pawns that don’t have any pawns on either side of them. Here they don’t have support
              from other pawns and if they are attacked they will require support from their pieces.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-container">
              <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/concepts/isolated-pawns.svg" alt="Illustration of isolated pawns">
                <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                  In this example white has 2 isolated pawns and black has 1.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              One thing to keep in mind is that although isolated pawns are generally weak, the open files next to them
              increases the mobility of your pieces, particularly for the rooks that enjoy open files.

              Doubled-pawns are 2 pawns that are stacked on top of each other. The main weakness of doubled-pawns lies
              in the fact that the rear pawn is restricted in its movement and also cannot defend the pawn in front of
              him.
            </p>

              Like isolated pawns, there are advantages in having an open file, and in some situations having doubled
              pawns can work together to control important squares like the center.

            <p>Backward pawns are pawns that:</p>
            <ul class="indent">
              <li>
                Cannot be protected by other pawns since it is further back than the other pawns.
              </li>
              <li>
                The square in front of is controlled by the opponent which means it cannot move forward without being
                captured.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="fig-container">

            </div>
            <p>
              A backward pawn is considered a weak pawn because it can be attacked on the file by enemy pieces and it
              cannot be defended by other pawns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those are some cases where your pawns are weak. Now lets take a look at when your pawns are strong.

            <h3 class="h5 subheader-link" id="connected-pawns">Connected Pawns</h3>
            <p>
              Connected pawns are pawns that have a pawn on either side of it. Connected pawns can usually defend each
              other and they are therefore considered strong. At the start of a new game all the pawns are connected but
              as the game continue and some exchanges are made the pawns become disconnected/weaker.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-container">
              <figure>

            <p>
              When a group of pawns gets disconnected from the rest of the pawn structure – they become a pawn-island.
              In the example illustration above both white and black have 2 pawn islands each. Generally, the more pawn
              islands you have, the weaker your pawn structure becomes, because you need resources to defend those pawn
              islands.

            <h3 class="h5 subheader-link" id="pawn-chains">Pawn Chains</h3>
            <p>
              Pawn chains consist in a group of pawns occupying a diagonal, therefore, in a pawn chain, every pawn is
              defended by the pawn in the line below. Chains always have a base: the first pawn, and the only one not
              defended by others; and a head, the most advanced pawn of all.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-container">
              <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/concepts/pawn-chains.svg" alt="Illustration of pawn chains">
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              Chains are usually pretty secure, and it is a good idea to defend your central pawns using them. However,
              the strength of the pawn chain depends on the security of the base, so if you want to undermine the pawn
              structure of your opponent, attacking this weakest point would be a great idea: but note that this is not
              always easy, and is more likely to result in an endgame, as there will be fewer pieces to defend it.

            <h3 class="h5 subheader-link" id="passed-pawns">Passed Pawns</h3>
            <p>
              A passed pawn is a pawn that cannot be confronted by any enemy pawns. Paseds pawns are very valuable
              strategic assets since your opponent will often have to allocate at least one piece to prevent the passed
              pawn from advancing even further.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-container">
              <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/concepts/passed-pawns.svg" alt="Illustration of a passed pawn">
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              When a passed pawn is supported by another pawn (as in the example above) it is called a protected passed
              pawn. A protected passed pawn is usually more valuable than an unprotected passed pawn.
            </p>
            <p>
              A protected passed pawn is an advantage that gives you a good chance of winning the game even if you are a
              pawn or two behind in material.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are the main patterns and concepts related to pawns. If you are presented with an opportunity to
              capture a piece with more than 1 pawn, it’s a good practise to capture toward the center, as the more
              squares you control in the center, the less space your opponent has to manouvre around.

          <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="piece-activity">Piece Activity</h2>
          <p>
            Different from a material advantage, piece activity is more of an abstract concept. A player can have less
            material than their opponent yet have more active pieces, which can lead to a decisive advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Probably the most famous example of this is the famous Opera Game , played between Paul Morphy and a duo of
            european noblemen, Duke Karl and Count Isuoard.
          </p>

              <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                Notice here white is down material, but almost all of his pieces are active. Black's kingside, on the
                other hand, is not in the game. Morhpy won this game is just in a few more moves.

          <p>
            The main takeaway here is to aim to continually increase the value of your pieces by developing them to more
            active squares. For example, Knights are stronger in the center as opposed to the edge of the baord.
            Remember active pieces have more firepower than poorly developed ones.

          <h2 class="h4 subheader-link" id="king-safety">King Safety</h2>
          <p>
            King safety is one of the most critical strategic concepts in chess. Having an unsafe king can be a losing
            disadvantage because it could lead to checkmate, and an exposed king doesn’t have any protection against
            checks and threats from enemy pieces either.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-container expandable">
            <figure class="full-width">
              <img src="assets/img/concepts/king-safety.svg" alt="Illustration of king safety">
              <figcaption class="text-caption align-center text-left">
                In this example the position is equal in material but white’s king is totally exposed. Black can play a
                tempo move like rook to e5 and white cannot block as the queen is more valuable than the rook and white
                also loses it’s castling privileges.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>Exposed kings are a big weakness as they can:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>
              Allow your opponent to gain tempo/development moves by putting your king in check
            </li>
            <li>
              A king can be victim to a tactic such as a fork or skewer if left exposed.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a king is in check, most of the other pieces become momentarily useless. In other words, when your
              king is in check your other pieces becomes mere “spectators” until the check against your king is dealt
              with.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Since the king is the most important piece in the game, keeping the king safe is critical. The easiest way
            to do this is to castle early. This achieves 2 objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            First the king moved away from the center of the baord. The center is usually the part of the board that
            opens up first. Since both players are fighting for control of the center, the center pawns often get
            exchanged – which opens up files in the middle of the board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, it also helps you to develop a rook by bringing it out of the corner and connects your rooks.

                Notice in this example that black is actually up in material but has left its king exposed and

                repitition because the king is exposed
